## Speech perception 
To understand human behavior, one cannot ignore the importance of speech perception to do so. Communication and other significant parts of our society are based on the way humans perceive and process language. Taking that into consideration, it is quite surprising that small components like phonemes, consonants, or vowels can have such a significant impact on language perception and are thus directly influencing our way of communicating or learning. Eager to learn more about how small language constituents affect our everyday life we choose to take a closer look at the paper “Brain Activation for Consonants and Vowels”, written by Manuel Carreiras and Cathy J. Price. Realizing that speech perception and processing are far more complicated than the average native speaker might think, we also inspected the findings and statements from the annual Linguistics review “How Consonants and Vowels Shape
Spoken-Language Recognition” composed by Thierry Nazzi and Anne Cutler.
